# 2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following.
# What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!
#
# a=2
# b=5
#
# print(b/a)              =2.5
# print(b//a)             =2
# print(b**a)             =25
# print(b%a)              =1

# #3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
# #into the Python Console Window?


a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)

# a = 15

# #4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!
#
# #forgot multiplication symbol
#
#
# '''
# x,y = (4,5)
# a=3*(x + y)
# print(a)
#
#
#
# #5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!
#
# #needed to put "print" in front of "ave" and needed parentheses
#
#
# x,y,z =(3,4,5)
# ave = (x+y+z)/3
# print(ave)
